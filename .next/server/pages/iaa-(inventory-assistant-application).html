<p>We built IAA for Android and iOS tablets with a <strong>camera-first design</strong>. Instead of clunky forms or RFID scanners, the AR camera was the main interface. It recognized objects, suggested descriptions using ML, and made collection management as easy as taking a photo. Under the hood it leaned on our KR API — combining Word2Vec + Elasticsearch for semantic search with computer vision models to identify assets visually.</p>
<p>I led the product engineering and development team through multiple iterations: from concept (literally training on the combined bookcases of our team) to web-based prototypes, and finally to the beta version that people could register to try. By 2022, we launched version 1.0 for both iOS and Android, shaped heavily by user feedback.</p>
<p>IAA was the first time we turned our research into a <strong>working, usable product</strong>. It proved that our backend technology could actually make life easier for real people managing collections — librarians, archivists, or anyone dealing with physical and digital assets. For me, it was a huge milestone: going from experimental APIs to a polished, camera-driven app that people could actually use.</p>
