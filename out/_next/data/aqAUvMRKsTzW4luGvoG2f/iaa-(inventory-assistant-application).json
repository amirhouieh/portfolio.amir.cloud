{"pageProps":{"project":{"html":"<p>IAA started as a side experiment to test what our Knowledge Recognition API could do in practice — and quickly grew into a full product. The idea was simple but powerful: point your tablet&#39;s camera at an object in a collection, and instantly know whether it&#39;s already in the inventory, check it in or out, or add it with enriched metadata generated on the fly.</p>\n<p>We built IAA for Android and iOS tablets with a <strong>camera-first design</strong>. Instead of clunky forms or RFID scanners, the AR camera was the main interface. It recognized objects, suggested descriptions using ML, and made collection management as easy as taking a photo. Under the hood it leaned on our KR API — combining Word2Vec + Elasticsearch for semantic search with computer vision models to identify assets visually.</p>\n<p>I led the product engineering and development team through multiple iterations: from concept (literally training on the combined bookcases of our team) to web-based prototypes, and finally to the beta version that people could register to try. By 2022, we launched version 1.0 for both iOS and Android, shaped heavily by user feedback.</p>\n<p>IAA was the first time we turned our research into a <strong>working, usable product</strong>. It proved that our backend technology could actually make life easier for real people managing collections — librarians, archivists, or anyone dealing with physical and digital assets. For me, it was a huge milestone: going from experimental APIs to a polished, camera-driven app that people could actually use.</p>\n<p><code>with</code> <a href=\"https://suslib.com\">Martijn de Heer</a></p>\n","link":"https://suslib.com/solution/inventory-assistant","title":"IAA (Inventory Assistant Application)","description":"<p>We built IAA for Android and iOS tablets with a <strong>camera-first design</strong>.
