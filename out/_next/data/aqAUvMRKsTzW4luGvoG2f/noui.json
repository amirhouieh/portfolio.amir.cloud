For this experiment, I used a dataset including the top 1000 websites with the most daily views. I am not quite happy with the results but now that the model is trained, it can be used for further (continue) training and hopefully get more coherent results. </p>\n<p>In order to create this dataset, I had to develop the software â‡¢ <a href=\"http://gridr.amir.cloud/\">http://gridr.amir.cloud/</a>.

In this step, I used a dataset including 1000 random data points (webpages). The result did not look good, but promising ðŸ¤žÂ The next step would be to create a more cohesive and clean dataset (probably limited to one particular domain), and train the model again. </p>\n<p>Link to Colab project â‡¢ </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/pix2pix.ipynb\">Google Colaboratory</a></p>\n","title":"noui","description":"<p>The first experiment was a StyleGAN2 generated web grid, an attempt to see how we can teach a GAN to draw a random grid(layout) of a website.
