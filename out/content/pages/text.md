This project is the online expansion of the publishing work of Pages, the bilingual, Farsi and English, artist magazine. This platform operates primarily as a working space, concerned with rethinking the politics and practice of archiving and publishing. It approaches publishing as a collective practice of generating an open, transparent archive. With minimum editorial mediation, the platform offers direct access to invited authors to publish their contributions, while making them instantly accessible to the reader. The central tool facilitating this is the automated mailing system which authors use to upload, edit, and expand on their contributions.
I was proudly involved in the research, design, and implementation phase of this project during my time at LUST/LustLab. I can honestly say that the Pages project was my best working experience during this time for two reasons: Firstly, because the project was about online publishing, a topic of special interest to me and secondly, because of my major position within the project which brought me a lot of responsibilities as well as challenges.
