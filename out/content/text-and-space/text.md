A Data driven spatial installation
at [`KABK`](https://www.kabk.nl), Den Haag

Text and Space is a physical translation of the text. I created a system which uses the text as input. It extracts the required data from the text in order to create an space and spacial experiment for the viewers.
Every word becomes a dot in a three dimensional space and by connecting the dots a new space is evolved. This project is one of my first attempts working with text and data as material and shaping my visuals through systematic approach.
