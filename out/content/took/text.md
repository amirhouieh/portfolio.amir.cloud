TOOK is an online reader generator that uses Wikipedia as its knowledge source. You can upload a text file (e.g: an article, a book, etc), and TOOK creates a new narrative based on important/relevant entities and keywords contextualized with Wikipedia articles.

Furthermore, you could also publish your reader with ❤️ and so it becomes available for everyone else.

The current version uses exact same algorithm for entity extraction, relevancy evaluation but is different in Technology. In the background, there is no use of advanced technologies such as NLP. It is purely the results of a semantic system and mechanism written in code.

#### Background
Took is an upgraded version of an old design research project about the future of reading with the title of "Tomorrow Book". Read more [here](https://portfolio.amir.cloud/tomorrow-book/)
