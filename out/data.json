Instead, we pieced it together ourselves: YOLOv3 and Mask R-CNN for object detection, Tesseract for OCR, spaCy for entity recognition, LDA for topics, and TextRank for summarization. For semantics we trained Word2Vec embeddings and dropped them into Elasticsearch to give collections a &quot;search by idea&quot; capability. It felt like hacking the future together with duct tape and GPUs.</p>\n","blurb":"AI-powered semantic search system that transforms collections into networks of meaning using computer vision and

Furthermore I discovered about the technique used by film in order to create a sound in one of the famous sequences. They used a audio feedback loop where speaker outputs the sound which it creates.\nHence this concept lead me a to design a system in which I could create my poster with: a visual feedback loop. The setup consist of a typography layer of title of the movie (as the initial material/input) and a tv screen (to output the visuals) and a camera (to catch the visual input).</p>\n","tags":["generative poster","alternative tool"],"slug":"2001-a-space-odyssey-poster-series","thumb":{"src":"images/amir_houieh-9NEWlJjNCck6y41eKI8tG-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-9NEWlJjNCck6y41eKI8tG-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-9NEWlJjNCck6y41eKI8tG-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-9NEWlJjNCck6y41eKI8tG-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6796_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},"images":[{"src":"images/amir_houieh-bLHSFkzV4PMdG3BIUy7Yn-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-bLHSFkzV4PMdG3BIUy7Yn-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-bLHSFkzV4PMdG3BIUy7Yn-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-bLHSFkzV4PMdG3BIUy7Yn-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6752_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-cee7fShOBsCYAgtiwI9Az-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-cee7fShOBsCYAgtiwI9Az-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-cee7fShOBsCYAgtiwI9Az-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-cee7fShOBsCYAgtiwI9Az-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6796_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-3nqNVHVqPLT3nmJmpi7SQ-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-3nqNVHVqPLT3nmJmpi7SQ-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-3nqNVHVqPLT3nmJmpi7SQ-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-3nqNVHVqPLT3nmJmpi7SQ-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6896_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-OHLOg_hYVdpvdfxkx0JLy-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-OHLOg_hYVdpvdfxkx0JLy-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-OHLOg_hYVdpvdfxkx0JLy-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-OHLOg_hYVdpvdfxkx0JLy-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6903_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-qkHQ0v8_F4s9tXR87pKH4-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-qkHQ0v8_F4s9tXR87pKH4-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-qkHQ0v8_F4s9tXR87pKH4-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-qkHQ0v8_F4s9tXR87pKH4-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6940_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-VzBSAyxKnc52y5Wayee_b-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-VzBSAyxKnc52y5Wayee_b-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-VzBSAyxKnc52y5Wayee_b-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-VzBSAyxKnc52y5Wayee_b-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_7168_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh--BdjQpq2GNdLhA-0HOCRn-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh--BdjQpq2GNdLhA-0HOCRn-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh--BdjQpq2GNdLhA-0HOCRn-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh--BdjQpq2GNdLhA-0HOCRn-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_7206-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5}],"stack":null,"dateString":"2013","dataYear":2013,"videos":[]},{"html":"<h1>Noui project</h1>\n<p>Noui project is a series of experiments towards my vision and definition of the future of UI/UX design in software development; First, adaptability and organic personalization of interface design of software and second Automation and the design process. </p>\n<p><strong>Experiment #1</strong></p>\n<p>The first experiment was a StyleGAN2 generated web grid, an attempt to see how we can teach a GAN to draw a random grid(layout) of a website.
