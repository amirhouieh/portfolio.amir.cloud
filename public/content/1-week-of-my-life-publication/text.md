1 week of my life is a series of artworks about one regular week of my life; one work for one day. This series could be consider as a irregular data-visualization representing the data.
The dataset was created by formulating my daily schedule into excel tables â€”categorizing my activities over the time(24hh). In order to make the data more humanized and so more flexible to make narratives, the third parameter was introduced: a parameter which represent my feeling regarding how slow or fast time is passed per activity category.

This process results into 5 different dataset(s) (Monday to Friday) which are used as content/input for the artworks. You can see the all other related projects at [archive.amir.cloud](https://archive.amir.cloud).
This publication is a generated visual book which is a documentation of these series. The book is design and programmed using html, css and javascript in web-browser.
