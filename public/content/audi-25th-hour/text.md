This is one of the projects which I worked on at RNDR.


25th Hour: Flow is a project by Audi in partnership with the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT), MobilityPartners and [RNDR](https://rndr.studio). Based on data obtained from a simulation conducted by KIT and MobilityPartners, 25th Hour visualizes the potential impact of autonomous cars, ride sharing and smart traffic management on the traffic of Ingolstadt, Germany.
