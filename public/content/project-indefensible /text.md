Project Indefensible emerged out of a series of research and discussion workshops on the global arms business. The result of this collaboration is the educational website and text of Indefensible. In order to stimulate this conversation, [LUST](https://lust.nl), where I worked as a designer and developer, approached the design and implementation of the website as a critical tool for collaborative reading and writing. LUST offered speculations on scalable reading experiences between all target audiences, situations, and locations centered on the thematics of the Indefensible text.
My contribution to this project was mainly implementation and software development including both back-end and front-end. As a result, the website for Indefensible offers the reader a set of tools which you can find at the online website.
