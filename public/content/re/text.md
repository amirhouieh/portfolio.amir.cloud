_A modular content-driven web browser_
[github.com/amirhouieh/re-](https://github.com/amirhouieh/re-)

Re is my graduation project, which already contains some of the key ideas of the Repub project. Re is a new web browser, altering the way we surf and consume on the web. Re empowers the user to embrace the content of the web pages as well as the design, empowering them to reflect on the way content is shown. Re is a modular platform within which users can decide what type of content they want to see on a webpage
This is enabled by creating and adding content modules to the browser. Therefore, Re becomes a super minimal browser which is faster, more reliable, and more efficient in terms of data-consumption by cutting off all the noises from a webpageâ€™s content.
