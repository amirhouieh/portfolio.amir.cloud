The workshop aimed to discuss and develop experimental publishing frameworks in our digital realm based on decentralized and distributed networks. The workshop consist of 4 lectures and one project assignment. The workshop was an extension to REPUB project. The lectures introduces topics such as content flow in digital environments, the fundamental of the web and decentralized networks like p2p.</p>\n<p>As the assignment students needed to design an alternative model for content production and consumption as well as distribution in form a publishing framework. In other words they needed to design how users could produce and manage their content as well as how this content is published through a an interface. The distribution part of framework must occur on a decentralized-distributed network.\nAt the end the workshop yields into several different projects which you can read more about on the website of the workshop.</p>\n",

While the research phase the concepts such as construction and deconstruction and recursive loops came to my focus point. Furthermore I discovered about the technique used by film in order to create a sound in one of the famous sequences. They used a audio feedback loop where speaker outputs the sound which it creates.\nHence this concept lead me a to design a system in which I could create my poster with: a visual feedback loop. The setup consist of a typography layer of title of the movie (as the initial material/input) and a tv screen (to output the visuals) and a camera (to catch the visual input).</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>2001 a space odyssey is a poster assignment â<a href=\"http://carvalho-bernau.com\">design by Susana Carvalho</a> â consist of 4 phases/iteration. While the research phase the concepts such as construction and deconstruction and recursive loops came to my focus point. Furthermore I discovered about the technique used by film in order to create a sound in one of the famous sequences. They used a audio feedback loop where speaker outputs the sound which it creates.\nHence this concept lead me a to design a system in which I could create my poster with: a visual feedback loop.
