Furthermore I discovered about the technique used by film in order to create a sound in one of the famous sequences. They used a audio feedback loop where speaker outputs the sound which it creates.\nHence this concept lead me a to design a system in which I could create my poster with: a visual feedback loop. The setup consist of a typography layer of title of the movie (as the initial material/input) and a tv screen (to output the visuals) and a camera (to catch the visual input).</p>\n","tags":["generative poster","alternative tool"],"slug":"2001-a-space-odyssey-poster-series","thumb":{"src":"images/amir_houieh-yjq1vekrNWSEX3VtWpb8d-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-yjq1vekrNWSEX3VtWpb8d-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-yjq1vekrNWSEX3VtWpb8d-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-yjq1vekrNWSEX3VtWpb8d-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6796_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},"images":[{"src":"images/amir_houieh-__LLfWNndcBSOqI1Eyj6k-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-__LLfWNndcBSOqI1Eyj6k-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-__LLfWNndcBSOqI1Eyj6k-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-__LLfWNndcBSOqI1Eyj6k-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6752_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-qTJjAR0eY39A70OCeAWdt-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-qTJjAR0eY39A70OCeAWdt-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-qTJjAR0eY39A70OCeAWdt-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-qTJjAR0eY39A70OCeAWdt-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6796_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-X_JejtEgJFaorpDnp-TLe-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-X_JejtEgJFaorpDnp-TLe-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-X_JejtEgJFaorpDnp-TLe-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-X_JejtEgJFaorpDnp-TLe-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6896_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-5ni57PKKLwfhapvCd6gfi-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-5ni57PKKLwfhapvCd6gfi-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-5ni57PKKLwfhapvCd6gfi-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-5ni57PKKLwfhapvCd6gfi-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6903_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-9jaVq_1Qah7tMQX6xGvn3-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-9jaVq_1Qah7tMQX6xGvn3-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-9jaVq_1Qah7tMQX6xGvn3-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-9jaVq_1Qah7tMQX6xGvn3-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6940_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-hRtT0NAP3nE5GrOkTo6Ut-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-hRtT0NAP3nE5GrOkTo6Ut-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-hRtT0NAP3nE5GrOkTo6Ut-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-hRtT0NAP3nE5GrOkTo6Ut-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_7168_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-lIcIrvxKxDzRlN1IOULhD-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-lIcIrvxKxDzRlN1IOULhD-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-lIcIrvxKxDzRlN1IOULhD-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-lIcIrvxKxDzRlN1IOULhD-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_7206-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5}],"stack":null,"dateString":"2013","dataYear":2013,"videos":[]},{"html":"<h1>Noui project</h1>\n<p>Noui project is a series of experiments towards my vision and definition of the future of UI/UX design in software development; First, adaptability and organic personalization of interface design of software and second Automation and the design process. </p>\n<p><strong>Experiment #1</strong></p>\n<p>The first experiment was a StyleGAN2 generated web grid, an attempt to see how we can teach a GAN to draw a random grid(layout) of a website.
