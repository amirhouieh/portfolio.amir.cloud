The lectures introduces topics such as content flow in digital environments, the fundamental of the web and decentralized networks like p2p.</p>\n<p>As the assignment students needed to design an alternative model for content production and consumption as well as distribution in form a publishing framework. In other words they needed to design how users could produce and manage their content as well as how this content is published through a an interface.
