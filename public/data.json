The lectures introduces topics such as content flow in digital environments, the fundamental of the web and decentralized networks like p2p.</p>\n<p>As the assignment students needed to design an alternative model for content production and consumption as well as distribution in form a publishing framework. In other words they needed to design how users could produce and manage their content as well as how this content is published through a an interface. The distribution part of framework must occur on a decentralized-distributed network.\nAt the end the workshop yields into several different projects which you can read more about on the website of the workshop.</p>\n",
