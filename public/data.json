Instead, we pieced it together ourselves: YOLOv3 and Mask R-CNN for object detection, Tesseract for OCR, spaCy for entity recognition, LDA for topics, and TextRank for summarization.

Furthermore I discovered about the technique used by film in order to create a sound in one of the famous sequences. They used a audio feedback loop where speaker outputs the sound which it creates.\nHence this concept lead me a to design a system in which I could create my poster with: a visual feedback loop. The setup consist of a typography layer of title of the movie (as the initial material/input) and a tv screen (to output the visuals) and a camera (to catch the visual input).</p>\n","blurb":"Generative poster series using visual feedback loops—camera captures screen output to create recursive, evolving visuals.","tags":["generative poster","alternative tool"],"slug":"2001-a-space-odyssey-poster-series","thumb":{"src":"images/amir_houieh-nqL0sYW6Z7N0-NF0RwA6B-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-nqL0sYW6Z7N0-NF0RwA6B-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-nqL0sYW6Z7N0-NF0RwA6B-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-nqL0sYW6Z7N0-NF0RwA6B-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6796_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},"images":[{"src":"images/amir_houieh-KFitZ1yNtwrVUgpjiQlxg-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-KFitZ1yNtwrVUgpjiQlxg-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-KFitZ1yNtwrVUgpjiQlxg-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-KFitZ1yNtwrVUgpjiQlxg-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6752_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-bmf5WfTh1CF6iS4NhUfKv-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-bmf5WfTh1CF6iS4NhUfKv-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-bmf5WfTh1CF6iS4NhUfKv-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-bmf5WfTh1CF6iS4NhUfKv-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6796_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-YfLs52IRjg9jGJdeDg6wZ-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-YfLs52IRjg9jGJdeDg6wZ-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-YfLs52IRjg9jGJdeDg6wZ-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-YfLs52IRjg9jGJdeDg6wZ-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6896_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-bwlCjOf_ncOhywLnnUSce-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-bwlCjOf_ncOhywLnnUSce-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-bwlCjOf_ncOhywLnnUSce-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-bwlCjOf_ncOhywLnnUSce-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6903_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-JkWCupOnMHL5AU5_mtTuU-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-JkWCupOnMHL5AU5_mtTuU-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-JkWCupOnMHL5AU5_mtTuU-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-JkWCupOnMHL5AU5_mtTuU-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_6940_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-gv5IRS-Gij8M4srBQifVd-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-gv5IRS-Gij8M4srBQifVd-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-gv5IRS-Gij8M4srBQifVd-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-gv5IRS-Gij8M4srBQifVd-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_7168_copy-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5},{"src":"images/amir_houieh-oHp0FL3yhhzHYQkwkIUMx-320.jpg","srcSet":[{"path":"images/amir_houieh-oHp0FL3yhhzHYQkwkIUMx-320.jpg","size":320},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-oHp0FL3yhhzHYQkwkIUMx-640.jpg","size":640},{"path":"images/amir_houieh-oHp0FL3yhhzHYQkwkIUMx-1024.jpg","size":1024}],"caption":null,"alt":"2001 a space odyssey / poster series-_mg_7206-2x.jpg","order":-1,"r":1.5}],"stack":null,"dateString":"2013","dataYear":2013,"videos":[]},{"html":"<h1>Noui project</h1>\n<p>Noui project is a series of experiments towards my vision and definition of the future of UI/UX design in software development; First, adaptability and organic personalization of interface design of software and second Automation and the design process. </p>\n<p><strong>Experiment #1</strong></p>\n<p>The first experiment was a StyleGAN2 generated web grid, an attempt to see how we can teach a GAN to draw a random grid(layout) of a website.
