    "description": "Managing UI state for generative data requires understanding multi-stage, streamed, and interpretative outputs, contrasting with CRUD models. Key strategies include handling streaming updates, managing context as a first-class state, treating each stage as a state machine, and incorporating retries as a feature."

    "title": "AI-native vs AI-forced",
    "description": "The rise of AI-native applications marks a pivotal shift in software design—where AI isn't just a feature, but the foundation. Yet, developers are held back by fragmented, AI-forced stacks that make building AI-native products complex, costly, and inefficient. In this blog, we explore the challenges of disconnected AI and product workflows, introduce the core components of AI-native software, and share how Unbody unifies these worlds into a seamless development stack to enable smarter, more adaptive applications."
